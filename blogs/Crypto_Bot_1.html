            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
              One of my latest projects is a crypto trading bot that capitalizes on funding rate arbitrage. In very broad strokes, funding rate arbitrage occurs when a crypto exchange pays perpetual futures traders a funding rate payment depending on whether they hold  long or short positions. The size of the payment is determined by the difference in token price between the perpetual contract market and the spot market. So my task as a developer was to create a bot that scans the funding rates across the market and when it sees a token with which trading will be profitable - when the funding rate reaches a certain amount - it takes a long or a short position on that token depending on whether the funding rate is positive or negative. This blog is just a brief overview on what I have been doing, experienced and learned as I work on building this bot.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
              When I first picked up this project I had only a bare bones grasp on cryptocurrency in general and certainly not the knowledge of the markets and nuances such as funding rates and maker and taker fees and determining what factors must be present for a  trade to  be profitable, but with help from the customer who commissioned this project as well as some research of my own I was able to learn these details and grasp the idea of what we were trying to accomplish. Basically, I was going to have to build a tool that accessed market data using an API and make decisions on whether or not to buy, what type of position to take based upon that data, and how to efficiently enter and exit the trade with minimal price impact
            </p>
            <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
              Now that I had the idea of what I needed to accomplish, it was time to make some pretty important decisions. The first was what language to build with. After researching, I finally settled on NodeJS  as the choice seemed to be between Node and Python - those were the most common languages I had seen used in my searches in GitHub - and I landed on Node due to personal preference and familiarity. But I had never had to make an API call before and I had never worked with asynchronous JavaScript either (more on that later). As a young frontend dev, all I had done previously was manipulate the DOM so backend stuff like this was a whole new world for me. 
            </p>
            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
              Next,  I had to read. A lot. We had decided to begin work with the KuCoin exchange so I pulled up the KuCoin API docs and started reading. After getting about half way through I realized that I would actually need to use the KuCoin Futures API so I started reading that. Remember that at the beginning I had no clue how to make an API call, so there was a lot of confusion, and stopping to watch a YouTube video or two about a certain topic to gain the background to understand what I was reading was common. But I finally figured out how to make an API call and started writing code. There is no specific API endpoint in the KuCoin Futures API so I had to figure out how to get that data, and with a little more bookwork I was able to figure that out, but as I was celebrating this minor victory I was immediately hit square in the face by another problem.
            </p>
            <h3>Async...Await</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
              I ran my program and it worked, I had a nice list of tokens with their funding rates printed in my console. I was pretty excited and I ran it again just to see my code do what it was supposed to, but this time it took forever. Obviously, when working with something like crypto speed is key, and a delay that long could cost the trader a lot of money. I set out to figure out what this problem was. I spent hours reading articles and blogs and watching YouTube videos to try and figure out why every so often my program would take significantly longer than I was comfortable with. In the end I found my answer where I had started - in the API documentation - and the answer was that I had to use asynchronous JavaScript. This was something I had heard about but never taken the time to learn - I liked manipulating the DOM so I had skipped over some of the fundamentals. Big mistake. Anyone out there planning on learning JS (or any programming language), don’t be like me. Learn the basics first. 
            </p>
            <p class="col-10">
                I was eventually able to figure out the problem for the methods I had already written, but it took a lot of work and a lot longer than it should have. Using the asynchronous method my program sometimes skips over a token which is taking too long to respond, but that is better than delaying the whole program and potentially losing a lot of money. 
            </p>
            <h3>Back to the Basics</h3>
            <p class="col-10">
                In order to make my future development more streamlined to avoid snafus like this I went back to the basics and bought a Udemy course on asynchronous JavaScript and am working on completing that before I work on attempting to program the rest of the operations. But I learned a valuable lesson that skipping a foundational concept can come back to bite you, and in this case it has cost me development time which is a shame, but my knowledge and experience is steadily growing. I’m learning a lot with this project and will happily keep you all updated on its progress and what I am learning and building.
